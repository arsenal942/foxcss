# README #

Fox is a lightweight, compact and simply all round awesome CSS framework that was built with one goal. To give web developers the CSS framework they've been needing for years. It's under 5kb (less when minified and GZipped), 300 lines (less if you want to have some unreadable CSS) and with such simplistic styling, it enables you to do what you do best. Design and Develop.
